This is the README file for the fix8 framework.

In this document you will find a brief description of the directory layout,
as well as a description necessary steps to build fix8.

The system is comprised of a compiler for generating C++ message and field encoders,
decoders and instantiation tables; a runtime library to support the generated code
and framework; and a complete client/server test application.

The basic directory layout is as follows:

./          root directory with configure
compiler/   the f8c compiler source
doc/        doxygen documentation (generated when built)
include/    header files for the runtime library and compiler
runtime/    runtime library source
schema/     quickfix FIX xml schemas
test/       test client/server source


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Documentation is available at <http://www.fix8.org/>.
All the source code is self-documenting using doxygen.


EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
=====================

Fix8 requires the followin third-party software (header files and
libraries) being installed to build properly:

- Poco C++ Libraries basic edition
- Intel Threading Building Blocks
- Berkeley DB C++


BUILDING ON UNIX/LINUX/MAC OS X
===============================

The build system is based on automake/autoconf/libtool.

% tar xvzf fix8-0.5.0.tar.gz
% cd fix8-0.5.0
% ./configure
% make
% make install
